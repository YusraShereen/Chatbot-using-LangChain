## Introduction

This repository showcases how to use LangChain with the GeminiPro vision model to accomplish various tasks. LangChain is a powerful tool for language model operations, and GeminiPro provides advanced vision capabilities.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YusraShereen/Chatbot-using-LangChain.git
    cd Chatbot-using-LangChain
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
